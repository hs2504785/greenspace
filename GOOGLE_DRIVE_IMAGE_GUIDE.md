**Example:**

- **Original:** `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz456/view?usp=sharing`
- **File ID:** `1ABC123xyz456`
- **Direct URL:** `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123xyz456`

### Step 6: Add URLs to Your Google Sheet

1. **Open your product listing sheet**
2. **In the "Images" column**, paste your direct image URLs
3. **For multiple images**, separate URLs with commas:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ABC123,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XYZ789
   ```

- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB per image
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Lighting**: Take photos in good natural light
- **Background**: Use clean, simple backgrounds

### Organization:

- **Folder Structure**: Create subfolders by product category
  ```
  My Product Images/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vegetables/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fruits/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Herbs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Flowers/
  ```
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names with dates
  ```
  tomatoes-red-organic-sept2025-1.jpg
  tomatoes-red-organic-sept2025-2.jpg
  ```

### Multiple Images:

- **Main Image**: First URL should be your best product photo
- **Additional Views**: Show different angles, packaging, size comparison
- **Limit**: Maximum 5 images per product for faster loading

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading?

1. **Check URL format**: Must be `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`
2. **Verify sharing**: Image must be "Anyone with the link can view"
3. **Test URL**: Paste the URL in a new browser tab to verify it shows the image

### Common Mistakes:

- ‚ùå Using the original sharing URL instead of direct URL
- ‚ùå Setting permissions to "Restricted" instead of "Anyone with the link"
- ‚ùå Including spaces in the URLs
- ‚ùå Not separating multiple URLs with commas
