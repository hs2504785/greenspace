## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

```sql
-- New fields added to tree_positions table
ALTER TABLE tree_positions
ADD COLUMN latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
ADD COLUMN longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
ADD COLUMN altitude DECIMAL(8, 3),
ADD COLUMN gps_accuracy INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN coordinates_captured_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN coordinate_source VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'manual';
```

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

#### GPS Capture Modal

- **Automatic GPS Detection**: Use device GPS for precise coordinates
- **Manual Entry**: Input coordinates from external GPS devices or surveys
- **Accuracy Indicators**: Show GPS accuracy with color-coded precision badges
- **Source Tracking**: Record how coordinates were obtained (GPS, survey, manual)

#### Enhanced Tree History Modal

- **Location Tab**: Dedicated tab showing both grid and GPS coordinates
- **Benefits Display**: Visual explanation of geotagging advantages
- **Map Integration**: Direct links to Google Maps for each tree
- **Precision Indicators**: Show GPS accuracy and capture timestamps

### 3. API Enhancements

#### Tree Position API (`/api/tree-positions/[id]`)

- **GET**: Retrieve tree position with GPS metadata
- **PATCH**: Update GPS coordinates with validation
- **Enhanced Data**: Location type, precision indicators, formatted coordinates

## Usage Workflow

### Adding GPS Coordinates to Trees

1. **Navigate to Tree**: Click on any tree in your farm dashboard
2. **Open Tree Details**: View the enhanced tree details modal
3. **Click GPS Button**: Click the location pin icon in quick actions
4. **Capture Location**:
   - **Automatic**: Use "Capture Current Location" for GPS detection
   - **Manual**: Enter coordinates from external devices
5. **Save**: Store coordinates with accuracy and source information
